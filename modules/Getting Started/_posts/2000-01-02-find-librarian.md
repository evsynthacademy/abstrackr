This is Erin Anthony. She is the Public Health and Research Support Librarian at Brown University’s School of Public Health. People like Erin can help you identify the best databases to use for your literature searches. She can also write long strings of search terms that can help gather the most comprehensive collection of research related to your questions.

It would be difficult to complete the search component of your systematic reviews without the guidance of someone like Erin. We are writing this course under the assumption that you’ll be working with a librarian to design your search. If you don’t have an in-house librarian, ask for help from a librarian at a local university or research hospital.

Once you’ve identified a librarian, you’re ready to start designing your literature search.
