## Using abstracts to refine your review

This step isn’t mandatory, but it can be very helpful, especially if you have accepted a very large number of abstracts during your abstract screening.  Often, time and resources for systematic reviews are limited, and it is not feasible to screen and extract data from every single full-text article you find.  To save yourself some time later on in the process, we recommend taking a second look at your accepted abstracts, before retrieving your studies in full-text.  You may recall our <a href = "http://evsynthacademy.org/pico-d/">Develop Your Question</a> course noted that inclusion criteria related to study design might need to be narrowed if the amount of information retrieved was too large to process. <br><br>

To do this, you may want to create a rough “data extraction form” to capture some basic information about your potentially relevant studies.  We’ll talk more about data extraction in another course. For now, you can create this form by just collecting some of the main PICO (D) elements from the abstracts of the articles that fit your inclusion criteria. Key elements to collect include:<br><br>

- The population of patients in the study
- The specific interventions/comparators
- The study design
- The sample size  



You can use this initial extraction form to sort your abstracts by the PICO(D) criteria you captured and help assess the scope of the literature from your search. For instance, If, during this process, you notice that you have a reasonable number of randomized, controlled trials among the abstracts you selected, you may no longer need to include nonrandomized studies in your review. Likewise, If you discover that your search results include many large studies, you may be able to adjust your inclusion criteria to capture only big scale research.

If you have multiple research questions, you may also want to note which question matches which abstract.  And if, upon closer inspection, you conclude that an abstract was incorrectly accepted during the first stage of screening, just record your reason for rejecting it at this stage.  This information should be included in your report, usually in the form of a “literature identification flow diagram” at the beginning of the results and a full list of rejected studies with their rejection reasons in an appendix.

Once you’ve used your abstracts to clarify and narrow down your search criteria, you’re ready to find and review the full text articles that seem relevant to your research questions.
