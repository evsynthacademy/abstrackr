## Full-Text Screening

Once you have compiled a list of abstracts that appear to satisfy your eligibility criteria, you will want to get the full-text documents to verify which will be included in the final review based on all of the PICO(D) criteria. This step is usually done in parallel with data extraction, which is the next course in our series. Before extracting each article, read it in full to make a final determination on whether it is eligible. If you find a study that should be rejected at this stage, make sure to record why in order to facilitate your final report and ensure transparency of the process.
