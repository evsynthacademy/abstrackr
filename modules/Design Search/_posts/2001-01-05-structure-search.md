## Structuring your Search

What is boolean logic?  This is just a fancy way of describing what happens when you connect your terms with “AND” and “OR” and occasionally, “NOT” to create a custom search string.  For a systematic review, the simplest way of doing this is to plug your specific PICO (D) elements and their synonyms into a formula like this:

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/search-structure-01.PNG" width="400" >
</center>


In some cases, you might also add:

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/search-structure-02.PNG" width="400" >
</center>

How do you include your comparators in your search? You have a few options. You can include the comparator in the sting of “ORs” with the intervention:

<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/search-structure-03.PNG" width="400" >
</center>

Or, you can create a separate search group for comparators and link that group to the rest of the search using “AND.”  This would be the case if you are only interested in certain specific comparisons.


<center>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/search-structure-04.PNG" width="400" >
</center>


Your approach will depend on your specific questions. <br><br>

If these complex chain of terms seem daunting, you can split your search into pieces.  Run a search of just your population terms, then just your intervention terms, then your study types. Then you can link the searches with AND in the Advanced Search screen in most databases, including all of the ones listed above.

As we’ve mentioned before, you’ll need to consult with a librarian to construct the best possible chain of boolean logic.

Why are we bothering with all of these search terms? When you’re conducting a systematic review, you want to start by erring on the side of finding too much evidence. We’ll talk about that on the next page.
