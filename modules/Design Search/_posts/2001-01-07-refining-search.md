## Refining Your Search

So, you’ve worked with a librarian to string together a long chain of terms and your search returned 200,000 articles. What do you do now? <br><br>

If your search returns too many records and you don’t have time or resources to screen them all, you can try the following:<br><br>

1. **Add filters** <br> 
Your database will have a series of filters you can use to narrow your search. Start by filtering your results by study type. If you are going to limit to certain study types, be sure to specify this in your protocol. Other filters that may work are publication date, age or gender of participants, and English language. Be aware that any of these can bias your search, depending on your research question and parameters.<br><br>
2. **Look for terms that might be exploding the search**<br>
There are some terms that might “explode” your search. Keep in mind that words can have multiple meanings and the database will not discriminate. A good example is the term “AIDS”. If you search for this term, you will get every abstract that includes the verb “aids”, which will lead to a lot of irrelevant citations.<br><br>
3. **Identify what you don’t want**<br>
If you have to, look at your results and see if there are any patterns of populations or terms you don't want (e.g. pregnant women). Then add them to your search using “NOT” VERY CAREFULLY.<br><br>
What if the reverse problem happens-  you carefully design your search and only come up with 50 articles? <br><br>
If your search returns very few records, or you are missing studies you expected to find, you can try:<br><br>
- **Look for more synonyms**<br>
Did your search strategy leave out any words that are similar to the terms in your research questions? Take another look at a thesaurus or look at studies you expected to find to see if there are MeSH terms you are missing. <br><br>
- **Get rid of quotation marks**<br>
If your terms are surrounded by quotation marks, you’re limiting your search to articles that contain those exact phrases. That means you’re leaving out literature that includes other variations of those same terms. For instance, a search with “kidney disease” will miss studies about disease of the kidney and kidney diseases. <br><br>
- **Use truncation** <br><br>
To capture multiple spellings of a term such as run, runs, running,  you can use truncation. That’s where you write the root of the word followed by an asterisk or other database-defined character.<br>
*Example:  hemorrhag* will capture hemorrhage, hemorrhaging, and hemorrhagic.*<br><br>   
- **Look for misspellings or different spellings**<br>
Did you know “anemia” is also spelled “anoemia”? When you’re searching international literature, you might run into cases where academics from different countries use different spellings for the same term. Use both versions to expand your search.<br><br>
- **Remove filters**<br>
If you feel like you’ve included all possible synonyms and MeSH terms in your search, try removing any filters you may have added.<br><br>

Once you’ve hit the sweet spot between finding too many studies and not enough, you’re ready to start looking at each individual article to determine if it truly addresses your research questions. We call this step “screening your studies.”
