## Goals of the search

When you’re searching for articles for a systematic review, you want to aim for high sensitivity or recall of the studies you want. In other words, you’d rather identify more false positives (articles that don’t really fit your research question) than false negatives  (accidentally leave out articles that DO fit your research question.) That’s because your goal is to avoid missing any relevant studies. At this stage, before you have looked at the articles, you often can’t be sure about a study’s relevance. So play it safe and keep it for a future closer examination. <br><br>
Because this approach requires that you cast a wide net with a very broad search, you will  almost always end up with many more irrelevant citations than relevant ones.  Time and resources can limit your ability to screen through and identify the correct studies, so it is important to strike a balance between sensitivity and specificity when you’re designing your search. This is another case where a librarian can help you create the best approach.<br><br>
It’s common to start with a search that is as broad as possible. Then, if the number of articles that fit that search is too overwhelming, you can narrow your strategy. We’ll talk about how to do that on the next page.
